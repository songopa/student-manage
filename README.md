# Overview

This is a Student Management System built in C# to demonstrate core language features and object-oriented programming principles. The application allows users to manage student records with persistent file storage, showcasing practical use of classes, inheritance, interfaces, and file I/O operations.

The primary goal of this project is to capture the C# fundamentals, including object-oriented design patterns, CSV file handling, and menu-driven console applications. Through building this system, I've learned how to structure data models, and create user-friendly command-line interfaces.
